# Comet common

_Comet is deprecated and we are decommissioning our internal installation. We
will only make minor changes until we plan on archiving these repositories in
early 2022. If you are using Comet, please create an issue to discuss Comets
future._

This is a Comet plugin.

## Comet

Comet is an alert distribution framework which allows you to distribute alerts
all the way to the resource owner with customizable owner lookup,
de-duplication, alert formatting as well as automated follow up and metrics.

Built with ❤️ at Spotify
